* [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) - Used as an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language

## What I learned

- Database Managment Abilities\
To have a collection of centralized data, I learned how to base the web-application into web-database-application.\
-  Designing abilities\
Regardless of programming language of choice , front-end programming allowed me to see how the app will interact with the design.
- Development Abilities
To accommodate the changing needed and numbers of the users the web application, I became familiar with Model View Controller architecture.
